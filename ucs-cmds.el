;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This library defines three commands:
;;
;;  * `ucsc-define-char-insert-cmd' - Define a command to insert a
;;                                    Unicode character.
;;
;;  * `ucsc-make-commands' - Define such commands for all Unicode
;;                           chars whose names match a regexp.
;;
;;  * `ucsc-insert' - Insert a Unicode character and possibly define a
;;                    command to insert it.
;;
;;  You can also use `ucsc-define-char-insert-cmd' or
;;  `ucsc-make-commands' in Emacs-Lisp code (such as in your init
;;  file) to define character-inserting commands.
;;
;;  * The names of the character-inserting commands created are the
;;    same as the char names, except that they are lowercase and any
;;    `SPC' chars in the character name are replaced by hyphens (`-').
;;
;;  * You can use a numeric prefix argument with a character-inserting
;;    command to insert multiple copies of the given character.
;;
;;  The character-inserting commands are tailor-made to insert a given
;;  Unicode character.  You can bind such a command to a key sequence,
;;  effectively adding Unicode characters to your keyboard.
;;
;;  Command `ucsc-insert' is a replacement for vanilla command
;;  `insert-char' (called `ucs-insert' prior to Emacs 24), which Emacs
;;  binds by default to `C-x 8 RET' and which lets you type input to
;;  complete against a Unicode character name and then inserts that
;;  character.
;;
;;  The behavior and code of `ucsc-insert' are identical to those of
;;  `insert-char' (`ucs-insert') except for what happens when you use
;;  a negative prefix argument:
;;
;;  1. It acts as if the prefix-arg value was positive.  So a value of
;;     -3 inserts three copies of the character, just as 3 does.
;;
;;  2. In addition to inserting the character, it uses
;;     `ucsc-define-char-insert-cmd' to define a command that you can
;;     use thereafter to insert that character.
;;
;;  Whenever `insert-char' does anything (it does nothing for a
;;  negative prefix arg), `ucsc-insert' does the same thing.  Because
;;  of this, I recommend that you bind `ucsc-insert' to `C-x 8 RET' as
;;  a replacement for `insert-char'.  Put this in your init file:
;;
;;    (define-key global-map [remap insert-char] 'ucsc-insert)
;;
;;  If you need only a few such commands for inserting particular
;;  Unicode characters, and you do not want to look up their code
;;  points, then using `ucsc-insert' or `ucsc-define-char-insert-cmd'
;;  to define them interactively is sufficiently convenient.  But
;;  these commands, like `insert-char', can be a bit slow if you use
;;  completion, because there are many, *MANY* completion candidates.
;;
;;  You can use `ucsc-make-commands' to quickly create a whole set of
;;  such commands for characters whose names are similar.  The list of
;;  commands (symbols) is returned.
;;
;;  You provide a regexp as the argument to `ucsc-make-commands'.  It
;;  is matched against all Unicode character names (in `ucs-names').
;;  An insertion command is created for each of the characters whose
;;  name matches.
;;
;;  For example, here are some tests to try.  You need a Unicode font.
;;  One of these fonts might help:
;;
;;   (set-frame-font "DejaVu Sans Mono-10")
;;   (set-frame-font "DejaVu Sans 10")
;;   (set-frame-font "Arial Unicode MS")
;;
;;  Sample command creations:
;;
;;   (ucsc-make-commands "^math") ; Math symbols
;;   (ucsc-make-commands "latin") ; Latin alphabet characters
;;   (ucsc-make-commands "arabic")
;;   (ucsc-make-commands "^cjk")  ; Chinese, Japanese, Korean characters
;;   (ucsc-make-commands "^box drawings ")
;;   (ucsc-make-commands "^greek [a-z]+ letter") ; Greek characters
;;   (ucsc-make-commands "\\(^hangul\\|^circled hangul\\|^parenthesized hangul\\)")
;;
;;
;;  Icicles Can Help
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  Use of the commands created using `ucsc-define-char-insert-cmd',
;;  `ucsc-make-commands', and `ucsc-insert' is enhanced by `Icicles'
;;  (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/icicles.el).
;;
;;  When you enter the command name or code point interactively, you
;;  can take advantage of the more powerful completion of `Icicles',
;;  including regexp, substring (a subset of regexp), and various
;;  kinds of fuzzy matching.
;;
;;  More importantly, you can use progressive completion, to match
;;  parts of a candidate name in any order.  And you can "chip away at
;;  the non-elephant", removing whole sets of candidates that match
;;  patterns that you are *not* interested in.
;;
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `ucsc-define-char-insert-cmd', `ucsc-insert',
;;    `ucsc-make-commands'.
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `ucsc-char-name', `ucsc-char-names', `ucsc-get-a-hash-key',
;;    `ucsc-get-hash-keys'.

(defun ucsc-insert (character &optional count inherit msgp)
  "Insert COUNT copies of CHARACTER of the given Unicode code point.
Interactively, prompts for a Unicode character name or a hex number
using `read-char-by-name'.

You can type a few of the first letters of the Unicode name of
CHARACTER, and use completion.  If you type a substring of the Unicode
name preceded by an asterisk `*' and use completion, it will show all
the characters whose names include that substring, not necessarily at
the beginning of the name.

Also accepts as input CHARACTER a hexadecimal number of Unicode code
point or a number in hash notation, e.g. #o21430 for octal, #x2318 for
hex, or #10r8984 for decimal.

Optional third arg INHERIT (non-nil when called interactively), says
to inherit text properties from adjoining text, if those properties
are sticky.

If COUNT is negative:

1. Insert (- COUNT) copies (so -3 acts the same as 3).

2. Define a command that inserts CHARACTER having the same name as the
character itself, but lowercase and with any spaces replaced by
hyphens.  For example, if the character is named `GREEK CAPITAL LETTER
DELTA', then the command, which inserts one or more such chars, is
named `greek-capital-letter-delta'.

You can then bind the created command to a convenient key.

Interactively, or with non-nil MSGP arg, echo confirmation of the
command creation."
